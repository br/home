LEAD INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEER, ZENDESK, 2011 - current

Transitioned from operations to building tools fulltime.  Support
developer and operations staff in making applications deployable,
maintaining the OS X developer workstation build, contribute to chef
cookbooks and chef hacks for compare/dry-run mode.  Recently, working on
SSAE16 compliance of deploys.

Built lots of fun things using these building blocks:

- alpha_omega: inspired by https://github.com/blog/1091-spring-cleaning,
  a fork of capistrano deploy recipes for persistent release workareas
  (for rollback, current, staged apps, and dedicated compare and
  migration).

- microwave: fork of chef solo for non-root application configuration,
  works with alpha_omega so code and configuration are deployed as a
  unit.

- tvdinners: cookbooks wrapped in a gem, for chef cookbook reuse.

- johnny: vagrant and veewee definitions for building basic Ubuntu distro
  images, as well as developer variants of the production environment.

- jason: bash library, using shflags and log4sh scripts, implements
  37signals' sub interface.

- paul: fork of hub, with git flow mixed in, along with a collection of
  git sub commands (to do cool stuff like encrypting the git repo with
  openssl, setting up a workarea using .gitsetup.yml)

- junas: a play on project janus, a vim framework in 100% vim

- cue: bash prompt library, can write plugins to add shell indicators.

- pancake: OS X software distribution with macports and homebrew package
  backends.

- macports: non-root, anchored binary MacPorts distribution

- rb-helper: git mixin to assist in ruby gems developer (easy bin/bump,
  bin/build, and bin/publish cli interface for all my gems)

- sigmeh: irssi client as a bot, includes attempt to make a king of Perl
  bundler using CPAN modules.

* Using Ubuntu, bash, ruby, bundler, chef, vagrant, capistrano, rvm,
  unicorn, runit, MacPorts, homebrew
