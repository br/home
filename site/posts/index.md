## doc-helper git mix-in
### Thu May 24 23:31:23 PDT 2012

I wanted a git repository I could merge into any project to apply theme,
article structure, and programming language support.  Most of my
projects have two audiences: command line users and developers.

Recently I attended ChefConf 2012 (San Francisco) where I worked on my
veewee/vagrant scripts.  The vagrant documentation is a pleasure to
read, so I forked the documentation branch of the vagrant project
(MIT licensed, yes!).  

At first I kept the theme and pruned the article structure to git any of
my projects.  Then I replaced it with orderedlist's modern github
pages theme, with a small graft from the minimalist theme.  Adding
bundler and bash shell scripts, the repository (doc-helper) was ready to
git fetch and git merge into any project.

I'm dogfooding the template with this blog and the github page for
doc-helper.  Will post links to the github repositories and pages when
I've written enough.
